# M.V.R.ESPRINT1 Pilot Brief

**Deterministic Assurance Overlay for Grid Operations**

*Prepared for ERCOT Engineering Review – March 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

M.V.R.ESPRINT1 provides a deterministic, cryptographically verifiable operational assurance layer for energy grid systems. It enhances existing infrastructure with zero-ambiguity event reconstruction and tamper-evident audit trails, addressing critical gaps in post-disturbance analysis and regulatory compliance.

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike traditional systems that optimize control, M.V.R.ESPRINT1 reconstructs every decision deterministically and proves it hasn't been altered.

---

## Problem Statement

Grid operators and regulators face significant challenges in:

- **Ambiguous Event Reconstruction**: Hours or days required to reconstruct disturbance causality from disparate logs
- **Tamper-Evident Audit Trails**: Lack of cryptographic proof that logs haven't been modified post-event
- **Deterministic Replay**: Inability to replay control decisions with exact input/output traceability
- **Regulatory Evidence**: Difficulty proving compliance with NERC BAL-001/002 and PRC standards

These gaps lead to prolonged investigations, disputed root causes, and increased compliance risk.

---

## Solution Overview

M.V.R.ESPRINT1 operates as a shadow-mode overlay that:

- Consumes existing telemetry (ICCP/PMU/SCADA)
- Generates deterministic control traces
- Produces tamper-evident attestation chains
- Enables zero-ambiguity reconstruction

**No Control Authority**: Zero operational risk – purely observational and analytical.

## Proposed ERCOT Pilot: Frequency Response Traceability

**Scope**: Shadow-mode deterministic trace engine for BAL-001 frequency events.

**Duration**: 3-6 months initial evaluation.

**Integration**: Read-only consumption of existing ERCOT telemetry feeds.

**Deliverables**:
- Replayable event logs for frequency deviations
- Control decision reconstruction with full traceability
- Cryptographic proof of log integrity
- Demonstration of post-event analysis acceleration

**Risk Level**: Zero – no control authority, no operational impact.

## Example Output

After processing a simulated frequency event:

```json
{
  "event": "frequency_deviation",
  "timestamp": 1710000000,
  "decision": "increase_generation",
  "inputs": {"frequency_hz": 59.91, "tie_line_mw": 150.0},
  "constraints": {"bal_001_threshold": 59.94, "ramp_rate_limit": 10.0},
  "attestation": {
    "decision_hash": "a1b2c3...",
    "pcr_digest": "d4e5f6...",
    "signature": "g7h8i9...",
    "prev_hash": "j0k1l2...",
    "timestamp": 1710000000
  },
  "verification": "valid"
}
```

**Verifier Result**: ✔ Chain verified: 128 records valid

## Phaseable Deployment Model

1. **Phase 0 - Passive**: Telemetry consumption, trace generation (current pilot)
2. **Phase 1 - Advisory**: Recommended setpoints and constraint flags
3. **Phase 2 - Guardrail**: Soft blocking of unsafe commands
4. **Phase 3 - Assisted Control**: Limited closed-loop authority

Each phase maintains zero operational risk until proven.

---

## Value Proposition

- **Immediate**: Accelerates disturbance analysis from hours to minutes
- **Defensible**: Cryptographically provable evidence for regulatory submissions
- **Scalable**: Foundation for broader grid assurance capabilities
- **Low-Risk**: Shadow-mode deployment with no control authority

## Next Steps

1. Review pilot brief and technical documentation
2. Schedule technical deep-dive with engineering team
3. Evaluate telemetry integration points
4. Plan 3-month shadow-mode pilot execution
