# M.V.R.ESPRINT1

Deterministic Governor for the Energy Sector

A sovereign kernel implementation for energy grid stability and regulatory compliance, built in Rust for maximum safety and determinism.

## Overview

M.V.R.ESPRINT1 implements a comprehensive energy grid governance system with the following key components:

- **Sovereign Kernel**: Core deterministic runtime with 1kHz control loops
- **TLBSS Integrity Engine**: Tri-Entity Boundary Stability System for grid physics modeling
- **Regulatory Policy Engine**: NERC/CIP/ISO compliance with legal citation tracking
- **Audit Guardian**: Non-agentic boundary certification and admissibility checking
- **Adversarial Harness**: Security testing against state corruption and authority escalation
- **Simulation Framework**: Deterministic testing with noise injection and latency simulation
- **Universal Execution Layer**: Cryptographically bound ingestion and execution of multi-language logic
- **Sovereign Bus**: Unified communication channel ensuring all interactions are auditable
- **Sovereign Trace**: Complete cryptographic audit trail from input to output

## Positioning for Grid Deployment

M.V.R.ESPRINT1 is designed as a **deterministic assurance and control overlay** that enhances existing grid infrastructure without operational risk. It focuses on risk reduction and evidence improvement for NERC compliance, not system replacement.

### NERC Mapping and Value Proposition

- **TLBSS Engines**: Support BAL control performance by enforcing constraint envelopes before AGC violations. Provide physics-based guardrails for frequency and voltage stability.
- **Sovereign Kernel (1kHz Loop)**: Ensures deterministic execution, removing timing ambiguity in control actions. Enables replay capability for post-event validation of BAL/PRC performance.
- **Sovereign Bus**: Structured and signed messaging reduces data ambiguity and coordination failures in PRC operations.
- **Sovereign Trace**: Provides cryptographically verifiable event reconstruction for disturbance and misoperation analysis, directly addressing NERC's challenges in proving incident causality.

### Differentiator: Zero-Ambiguity Reconstruction

Unlike traditional systems that optimize control, M.V.R.ESPRINT1 reconstructs every control decision deterministically and proves it hasn't been altered. This enables:

- Replayable event logs for frequency events
- Control decision reconstruction with full input/output traceability
- Tamper-evident audit chains for regulatory compliance

### Phaseable Integration Model

M.V.R.ESPRINT1 integrates incrementally to minimize risk:

1. **Phase 0 - Passive**: Read-only telemetry consumption (ICCP/PMU/SCADA mirror). Generates traces and predicted actions without control authority.
2. **Phase 1 - Advisory**: Outputs recommended AGC setpoints and constraint violations. Operators see "Kernel recommends X".
3. **Phase 2 - Guardrail**: Soft constraints block unsafe commands and flag violations before execution.
4. **Phase 3 - Assisted Control**: Limited closed-loop authority in narrow, well-defined scopes.

### Proposed ERCOT Pilot: Frequency Response Traceability

A shadow-mode deterministic trace engine for frequency events:

- **No Control Authority**: Zero operational risk
- **Existing Telemetry**: Consumes current ICCP/PMU feeds
- **Deliverables**:
  - Replayable event logs for BAL-001 compliance
  - Control decision reconstruction for disturbance analysis
  - Cryptographic proof of log integrity

This pilot demonstrates immediate audit value while establishing a foundation for future control enhancements.

### Example Output Artifact

After processing a simulated frequency event, M.V.R.ESPRINT1 produces verifiable records like:

```json
{
  "event": "frequency_deviation",
  "timestamp": 1710000000,
  "decision": "increase_generation",
  "inputs": {
    "frequency_hz": 59.91,
    "tie_line_mw": 150.0
  },
  "constraints": {
    "bal_001_threshold": 59.94,
    "ramp_rate_limit": 10.0
  },
  "attestation": {
    "decision_hash": "a1b2c3...",
    "pcr_digest": "d4e5f6...",
    "signature": "g7h8i9...",
    "prev_hash": "j0k1l2...",
    "timestamp": 1710000000
  },
  "verification": "valid"
}
```

These records enable zero-ambiguity reconstruction of control decisions and their cryptographic integrity.

### Pilot Demo

Run the included pilot demonstration:

```bash
cargo run --bin pilot_demo
```

This simulates a frequency event sequence, generates attestation records, and verifies the chain integrity, producing output suitable for evaluation by ISO engineers.

## Failure Handling Philosophy

M.V.R.ESPRINT1 does not assume perfect inputs.
Instead, it:

- Records all received telemetry without alteration
- Flags inconsistencies explicitly in SovereignTrace
- Maintains deterministic outputs even under degraded conditions
- Ensures all ambiguity is surfaced, not hidden

This enables operators to distinguish between:
- control failure
- telemetry failure
- external disturbance

## High-Level Architecture Flow

The sovereign kernel operates as a closed-loop regulatory geometry system:

1. **Substrate Input Processing**: `sovereign_runtime` receives external setpoints and sensor data
2. **TLBSS Physics Modeling**: `tlbss_integrity_engine` computes grid stability invariants and plant-class envelopes
3. **Regulatory Policy Application**: `regulatory_policy` maps physical conditions to governance modes (Normal/Degraded/Emergency)
4. **Audit Guardian Certification**: `audit_guardian` performs boundary admissibility checks and vetoes unsafe transitions
5. **Sovereign Trace Generation**: `sovereign_trace` creates immutable audit trails with legal citations

**Harness Integration Points**:
- `adversarial_harness` injects security vectors at the substrate boundary
- `simulation_harness_core` provides deterministic shadow execution for validation
- `zero_state_sanity` validates boot integrity before operational transitions

## Module Interaction Explanation

The system forms a regulatory closed loop where physics, policy, and audit are inseparable:

- **Grid Physics (TLBSS)**: Models resonance curves, saturation limits, and fault-ride-through windows for different plant classes
- **Regulatory Policy**: Translates NERC/CIP/ISO text into executable invariants and governance modes
- **Audit Logic**: Non-agentic certification ensures all transitions maintain system admissibility
- **Sovereign Trace**: Every decision is justified with exact regulatory citations and timestamps

This architecture makes non-compliant states constrained, detected, and
made explicitly auditable through deterministic enforcement.

## Universal Execution Layer

M.V.R.ESPRINT1 can ingest, normalize, and execute logic written in any programming language while maintaining full cryptographic auditability. The Universal Execution Layer is primarily intended for
non-critical logic ingestion, simulation, and advisory workflows.
All production control paths remain deterministic and restricted.

### Cryptographic Input Binding

All inputs entering the system are cryptographically bound through a complete pipeline:

1. **Input Envelope**: Every input is wrapped in a canonical `InputEnvelope` with actor identity, origin language, and raw bytes
2. **Raw Input Hashing**: SHA-256 hash computed before any processing
3. **IR Normalization**: Foreign code converted to deterministic Intermediate Representation (IR)
4. **IR Hashing**: Normalized IR hashed for tamper evidence
5. **Rust Code Generation**: IR compiled to deterministic Rust code
6. **Code Hashing**: Generated Rust code hashed
7. **Execution**: Code executed in sovereign kernel with result hashing
8. **Output Translation**: Results translated back to origin language with final hashing

### Causal Hash Chain

The system maintains a complete cryptographic chain: `raw_input_hash → ir_hash → rust_hash → execution_hash → output_hash`

### Sovereign Bus

All communication flows through the `SovereignBus`, ensuring:
- No actor can bypass audit logging
- All messages are signed or kernel-signed
- Complete traceability of all interactions
- Unified communication for humans, AIs, devices, and subsystems

### Supported Languages

- Python (frontend stub)
- JavaScript (frontend stub)  
- C# (frontend stub)
- Go (frontend stub)
- Rust (native)

This enables M.V.R.ESPRINT1 to serve as a universal deterministic substrate for energy sector logic while providing regulator-grade cryptographic evidence for every operation.
